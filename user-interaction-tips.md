# 🤝 User Interaction Tips — Dalal’s Notes

Because good support isn’t only about fixing devices — it’s about calming humans 😅

---

### 💬 During the issue
- Stay calm even when the user isn’t — their frustration is about the issue, not about you.  
- Ask clear questions before touching the device:  
  *“When did it start?”* / *“What exactly happened?”*  
- Narrate what you’re doing as you troubleshoot — users relax when they understand what’s happening.  
- Use pauses wisely: silence feels like confusion to users, so explain your next step out loud.  

---

### 🙌 After the fix
- Always confirm it’s fully resolved before leaving: *“Try it now, just to be sure.”*  
- End with a short positive phrase: *“You’re good to go!”* / *“All set 👌”*  
- If it took long, acknowledge their patience — “Thanks for waiting, I know it was a bit annoying.”

### 🧠 Extra Reminders
- Never assume the user knows technical terms — explain in their language.  
- Stay professional but friendly. A calm tone builds trust faster than tech jargon.  
- The user doesn’t remember your fix — they remember how you made them feel.

Reassuring the user is emotional support.” — Dalal Alsulami*
